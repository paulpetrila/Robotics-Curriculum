# Robotics Curriculum

## Modules 

### 1st Module - Basic concepts - 2h 
 
After completing the first module, the child should be able to explain what a robot is and how it functions (sensors, motors, logic, commands). The next module will explain the basics further, but this module is meant to show them what is possible and how it is to grasp. Showing them what they will build is essential in how they will perceive the next modules and how much interest they will show in them. 
I'm going to use the scientific method^[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257557027_Using_the_Scientific_Method_to_Guide_Learning_An_Integrated_Approach_to_Early_Childhood_Curriculum] to teach the children, by going through the following steps:
1. Observation: Showing the finished robot do tasks. The teacher will help by defining what is being observed. 
2. Generating questions that the children want to be answered based on the observations.
3. Predictions and arriving at a hypothesis regarding the answers to that question 
4. Engaging in experimentation and testing by making them break connectors and repair the robot 

After showing them around the robot, I'm going to give them a 3d printed version of a 6dof robot and try to make them understand that each joint behaves differently and have different restrictions. Continuing the scientific experiment, we'll find a way to express movement in the xyz space to the 6 degrees of freedom, thus teaching about getting to yaw, pitch and roll. 
After that, we're going to simplify to a 3dof robot - a 3d printer. And we're going to print a little 2dof robot.

### 2nd Module - 

## Target audience 

1. Age brackets 

Age brackets aren't the best idea, but they should start as a starting point for getting started in the curriculum. If they have no prior experience with coding and they are between 6 and 10, children should start at the first module. If they show interest in the field and want to learn more, the second module introduces more abstract concepts like electronics and coding. The children should have the base concepts (i.e. what's a robot, how does electricity work etc) before starting the 2nd module.
